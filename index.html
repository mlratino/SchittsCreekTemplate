// We start the game with a score of 0.
var score = 0;
    // Variable to hold the index of current question.
    var questionIndex = 0;

    // FUNCTIONS
    // ==============================================================================

    // Function to render questions.
    function renderQuestion() {
      // If there are still more questions, render the next one.
      if (questionIndex <= (questions.length - 1)) {
        document.querySelector("#question").innerHTML = questions[questionIndex].q;
      }
      // If there aren't, render the end game screen.
      else {
        document.querySelector("#question").innerHTML = "Game Over!";
        document.querySelector("#score").innerHTML = "Final Score: " + score + " out of " + questions.length;
      }
    }

    // Function that updates the score...
    function updateScore() {
      document.querySelector("#score").innerHTML = "Score: " + score;
    }


    // MAIN PROCESS
    // ==============================================================================

    // Calling functions to start the game.
    renderQuestion();
    updateScore();
//     When you interact with the keyboard, the keyboard events are fired. There are three main keyboard events:

// keydown – fires when you press a key on the keyboard and it fires repeatedly while you holding down the key.
// keyup – fires when you release a key on the keyboard.
// keypress – fires when you press a character keyboard like a,b, or c, not the left arrow key, home, or end keyboard, … The keypress also fires repeatedly while you hold down the key on the keyboard.
// The keyboard events typically fire on the text box, through all elements support them.

// When you press a character key once on the keyboard, three keyboard events are fired in the following order:

// keydown
// keypress
// keyup
// Both keydown and keypress events are fired before any change made to the text box, whereas the keyup event fires after the changes have made to the text box. If you hold down a character key, the keydown and keypress are fired repeatedly until you release the key.

// When you press a non-character key, the keydown event is fired first followed by the keyup event. If you hold down the non-character key, the keydown is fired repeatedly until you release the key.

    // When the user presses a key, it will run the following function...
    document.onkeyup = function(event) {

      // If there are no more questions, stop the function.
      if (questionIndex === questions.length) {
        return;
      }

      // Determine which key was pressed, make it lowercase, and set it to the userInput variable.
      var userInput = event.key.toLowerCase();

      // Only run this code if "t" or "f" were pressed.
      if (userInput === "t" || userInput === "f") {

        // If they guess the correct answer, increase and update score, alert them they got it right.
        if (userInput === questions[questionIndex].a) {
          alert("Correct!");
          score++;
          updateScore();
        }
        // If wrong, alert them they are wrong.
        else {
          alert("Wrong!");
        }

        // Increment the questionIndex variable and call the renderQuestion function.
        questionIndex++;
        renderQuestion();

      }
