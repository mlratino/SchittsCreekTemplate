{ q: "**April - June**: As frost danger passes, transplant seedlings outdoors, incorporating trellises and old wooden crates for a rustic aesthetic. Sow seeds for medicinal flowers like echinacea and calendula, which will thrive in the summer months. Decorate the garden with homemade plant markers.", a: "t" },

{ q: "**April**: Start fast-growing herbs like basil, cilantro, and dill. You can also begin sowing root vegetables like carrots and beets directly in the greenhouse, where the soil is warmer.",a: "t" },

{ q:"**May**: Transplant your indoor seedlings, such as tomatoes and peppers, to the outdoor garden. Begin direct sowing beans, squash, and cucumbers, as the risk of frost diminishes.*June**: Focus on succession planting for crops like lettuce and radishes to ensure a continuous harvest. You can also start planting heat-loving herbs like rosemary and thyme in the greenhouse.",a: "t"},

{ q: "**July - September**: Harvest summer vegetables such as tomatoes, zucchini, and peppers. Begin succession planting for fall crops like cabbage and carrots. Introduce spooky elements like pumpkin patches and corn stalks to tie in with the Halloween spirit.- **June to August:** During these warmer months, the cold frame can be used to protect delicate seedlings from pests or to harden off plants from the greenhouse.- **September:** Sow a late crop of spinach and radishes for an autumn harvest. You can also start fall greens like Swiss chard and mustard greens.", a: "t" },



{ q: "**October - December**: Collect and preserve herbs and flowers for medicinal uses, and save seeds for next year. Decorate your garden with Tim Burton-inspired ornaments, like ghostly lights and zero-the-dog garden statues, to celebrate both Halloween and Christmas.- **October:** Plant garlic and overwintering onions in the cold frame for a head start next spring. Begin preparing for winter by planning what will overwinter in the frame.", a: "t" },

{ q: "- **November to December:** Use the cold frame to protect any surviving greens and root vegetables from frost. You can also start hardy winter greens like mache and claytonia to enjoy fresh produce through the colder months.- **November to December:** Use the cold frame to protect any surviving greens and root vegetables from frost.

    // FUNCTIONS
    // ==============================================================================

    function renderQuestion() {
      // If there are still more questions, render the next one.
      if (questionIndex <= (questions.length - 1)) {
        document.querySelector("#question").innerHTML = questions[questionIndex].q;

    // MAIN PROCESS
    // ==============================================================================

    // Calling functions to start the game.
    renderQuestion();
    updateScore();
//     When you interact with the keyboard, the keyboard events are fired. There are three main keyboard events:

// keydown – fires when you press a key on the keyboard and it fires repeatedly while you holding down the key.
// keyup – fires when you release a key on the keyboard.
// keypress – fires when you press a character keyboard like a,b, or c, not the left arrow key, home, or end keyboard, … The keypress also fires repeatedly while you hold down the key on the keyboard.
// The keyboard events typically fire on the text box, through all elements support them.

// When you press a character key once on the keyboard, three keyboard events are fired in the following order:

// keydown
// keypress
// keyup
// Both keydown and keypress events are fired before any change made to the text box, whereas the keyup event fires after the changes have made to the text box. If you hold down a character key, the keydown and keypress are fired repeatedly until you release the key.

// When you press a non-character key, the keydown event is fired first followed by the keyup event. If you hold down the non-character key, the keydown is fired repeatedly until you release the key.

    // When the user presses a key, it will run the following function...
    document.onkeyup = function(event) {

      // If there are no more questions, stop the function.
      if (questionIndex === questions.length) {
        return;
      }

      // Determine which key was pressed, make it lowercase, and set it to the userInput variable.
      var userInput = event.key.toLowerCase();

      // Only run this code if "t" or "f" were pressed.
      if (userInput === "t" || userInput === "f") {

        // If they guess the correct answer, increase and update score, alert them they got it right.
        if (userInput === questions[questionIndex].a) {
          alert("Correct!");
          score++;
          updateScore();
        }
        // If wrong, alert them they are wrong.
        else {
          alert("Wrong!");
        }

        // Increment the questionIndex variable and call the renderQuestion function.
        questionIndex++;
